Research on energy production and storage systems and the creation of fundamental knowledge about materials



I have been conducting research on energy production and storage systems, and I plan to continue this work in the future. So far, my research has focused on energy storage, particularly on battery systems. My research topics include:

1.	Study of bifunctional catalysts for lithium-ion batteries
2.	Comparative study on the performance of zinc powder anodes based on the degree of HER inhibitor coating on the zinc powder surface and analysis of the underlying causes
3.	Research on binders for zinc powder anodes and analysis of the synergistic effects between active materials and binders

These two studies on aqueous zinc-ion batteries are currently ongoing and are expected to continue until the end of June 2025.

In the future, my research will shift to focus on hydrogen fuel cells, which will differ from my previous work. The planned topics include:

1.	Research to enhance hydrogen production and storage efficiency
2.	Research to improve the efficiency of energy-generating reactions in hydrogen fuel cells
3.	Research on the application of microdroplets to hydrogen fuel cells

This outlines the research I have conducted so far, my ongoing projects, and my plans for future research.
